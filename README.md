# Java Portfolio for Junior Developer

Welcome! I'm Anna, a beginner Java developer transitioning from Python. This portfolio showcases my two projects. They demonstrate progression from Java Core basics to a full Spring Boot REST API. I'm eager to learn and contribute as a Junior Java Developer!

## Skills
- **Java Core:** OOP, Collections (ArrayList, HashMap), Streams API, Generics, Exceptions.
- **Spring Boot:** MVC, @RestController, @Service, @Repository, Auto-configuration.
- **Databases:** JPA/Hibernate, H2 (in-memory), Basic SQL (SELECT, WHERE).
- **Tools:** Maven, Git, IntelliJ IDEA, Postman for testing.
- **From Python:** Logic and data structures.

## Projects

### 1. Console Task Manager (TODO List)
- **Description:** Simple CLI app for task management: add, list, filter unfinished (using Streams), mark done, delete.
- **What I Learned:** OOP (classes, getters/setters), Collections, Streams (filter, forEach), Scanner.
- **Link:** [Code](project1/taskmanager/)

### 2. Employee Management CRUD API
- **Description:** RESTful API for employees: CREATE/READ/UPDATE/DELETE (/employees). Filters by department and salary (>70k with Streams), validation, H2 DB with auto-tables.
- **What I Learned:** Spring Boot (@Autowired, @RestController), JPA (@Entity, Repository), Validation (@Valid), ResponseEntity for statuses.
- **Endpoints:** POST /employees (create), GET /employees (list), PUT /employees/{id} (update), DELETE /employees/{id} (delete), GET /employees/high-salary (filter).
- **Link:** [Code](project2/employee-crud/)
